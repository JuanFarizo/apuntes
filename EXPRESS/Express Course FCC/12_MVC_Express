------MVC EN EXPRESS--------


MODEL (BUSINESS LOGIC) ==>> VIEW (PRESENTATION LOGIC) ==>> CONTROLLER (APPLICATION LOGIC).

CONTROLLERS: Handdle aplication's request, interact with models and sen back resposes to the client.
 

MVC en el contexto de una app:

Request => Router (Su funcion es direccionar la peticion a la funcion handler) => Controller <=> Model/View (Segun la request puede necesitar interacturar con el Model) => Response 

BUSINESS LOGIC: Code that actually solves the business problem we set out to solve.
Directly related to business rules, how the business works, and business needs.
Eg.:
	Validationg user input data
	Ensuring only users who bought a tour can review it

APPLICATION LOGIC: Code that is only concerned about the application's implementations, not the underlying business problem.
Concerned about managing requests and responses.
About the app's technical aspects.
Bridge between model and view layers.



Filosofia :
			FAT MODELS / THIN CONTROLLER: Offload as much logic as possible into the models, and keep the controllers as simple and lean as possible.
